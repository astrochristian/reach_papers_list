B-GSM aims to address the limitations of previous models by incorporating robust error quantification and calibration. Using nested sampling, we compute Bayesian evidence and posterior distributions for the spectral behaviour and spatial amplitudes of diffuse emission components. Bayesian model comparison is used to determine the optimal number of emission components and their spectral parametrisation. Posterior sky predictions are conditioned on both diffuse emission and absolute temperature datasets, enabling simultaneous component separation and calibration. B-GSM is validated against a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the partial sky coverage, thermal noise, and calibration uncertainties present in real observations of the diffuse sky at low frequencies. B-GSM correctly identifies a model parametrisation with two emission components featuring curved power-law spectra. The posterior sky predictions agree with the true synthetic sky within statistical uncertainty. We find that the root-mean-square (RMS) residuals between the true and posterior predictions for the sky temperature as a function of LST are significantly reduced, when compared to the uncalibrated dataset. This indicates that B-GSM is able to correctly calibrate its posterior sky prediction to the independent absolute temperature dataset. We find that while the spectral parameters and component amplitudes exhibit some sensitivity to prior assumptions, the posterior sky predictions remain robust across a selection of different priors.

Fitting for a physics-motivated parametric forward model of the data within a Bayesian framework provides a robust means to separate the signal from the foregrounds, given sufficient information about the instrument and sky. It has previously been demonstrated that, within such a modelling framework, a foreground model of sufficient fidelity can be generated by dividing the sky into N regions and scaling a base map assuming a distinct uniform spectral index in each region. Using the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen as our fiducial instrument, we show that, if unaccounted-for, amplitude errors in low-frequency radio maps used for our base map model will prevent recovery of the 21-cm signal within this framework, and that the level of bias in the recovered 21-cm signal is proportional to the amplitude and the correlation length of the base-map errors in the region. We introduce an updated foreground model that is capable of accounting for these measurement errors by fitting for a monopole offset and a set of spatially dependent scale factors describing the ratio of the true and model sky temperatures, with the size of the set determined by Bayesian evidence-based model comparison. We show that our model is flexible enough to account for multiple foreground error scenarios allowing the 21-cm sky-averaged signal to be detected without bias from simulated observations with a smooth conical log spiral antenna.", "alternate_bibcode": ["2023MNRAS.tmp.3244P", "2022arXiv221110448P"], "author": ["Pagano, Michael", "Sims, Peter", "Liu, Adrian", "Anstey, Dominic", "Handley, Will", "de Lera Acedo, Eloy"], "date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z", "doi": ["10.1093/mnras/stad3392", "10.48550/arXiv.2211.10448"], "first_author": "Pagano, Michael", "issue": "3", "keyword": ["methods: observational", "methods: statistical", "dark ages", "reionization", "first stars", "large-scale structure of Universe", "Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics", "Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"], "pub": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "pubdate": "2024-01-00", "title": ["A general Bayesian framework to account for foreground map errors in global 21-cm experiments"]}, {"bibcode": "2023PhRvD.108f2006L", "abstract": "Interfering signals such as radio frequency interference from ubiquitous satellite constellations are becoming an endemic problem in fields involving physical observations of the electromagnetic spectrum.

We present a strategy to reduce this overlap between the 21-cm and foreground modes by simultaneously fitting the spectra from multiple different antennas, which can be used in combination with the method of utilizing the time dependence of foregrounds while fitting multiple drift scan spectra. To demonstrate this idea, we consider two different foreground models (i) a simple foreground model, where we assume a constant spectral index over the sky, and (ii) a more realistic foreground model, with a spatial variation of the spectral index. For the simple foreground model, with just a single antenna design, we are able to extract the signal with good accuracy if we simultaneously fit the data from multiple time slices. The 21-cm signal extraction is further improved when we simultaneously fit the data from different antennas as well. This improvement becomes more pronounced while using the more realistic mock observations generated from the detailed foreground model.

From the analyses, we found that the magnitude of the ionospheric disruptions due to ionospheric refraction and absorption can be greater than the expected global 21-cm signal, and the variation of its magnitude can differ, depending on the ionospheric conditions. Within the parameter space adopted in the model, the shape of the global 21-cm signal is distorted after propagating through the ionosphere, while its amplitude is weakened. It is observed that the ionospheric effects do not cancel out over time, and thus should be accounted for in the foreground calibration at each timestep to account for the chromaticity introduced by the ionosphere.", "alternate_bibcode": ["2020arXiv201110517S", "2021MNRAS.tmp..498S"], "author": ["Shen, Emma", "Anstey, Dominic", "de Lera Acedo, Eloy", "Fialkov, Anastasia", "Handley, Will"], "date": "2021-05-01T00:00:00Z", "doi": ["10.1093/mnras/stab429", "10.48550/arXiv.2011.10517"], "first_author": "Shen, Emma", "issue": "1", "keyword": ["atmospheric effects", "methods: data analysis", "Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics", "Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics", "Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"], "pub": "Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society", "pubdate": "2021-05-00", "title": ["Quantifying ionospheric effects on global 21-cm observations"]}, {"bibcode": "2021MNRAS.502.4405B", "abstract": "Maximally Smooth Functions (MSFs) are a form of constrained functions in which there are no inflection points or zero crossings in high-order derivatives. Consequently, they have applications to signal recovery in experiments where signals of interest are expected to be non-smooth features masked by larger smooth signals or foregrounds. They can also act as a powerful tool for diagnosing the presence of systematics. The constrained nature of MSFs makes fitting these functions a non-trivial task. We introduce MAXSMOOTH, an open-source package that uses quadratic programming to rapidly fit MSFs. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of MAXSMOOTH by comparison to commonly used fitting routines and show that we can reduce the fitting time by approximately two orders of magnitude. We introduce and implement with MAXSMOOTH Partially Smooth Functions, which are useful for describing elements of non-smooth structure in foregrounds. This work has been motivated by the problem of foreground modelling in 21-cm cosmology. We discuss applications of MAXSMOOTH to 21-cm cosmology and highlight this with examples using data from the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) and the Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) experiments. We demonstrate the presence of a sinusoidal systematic in the EDGES data with a log-evidence difference of 86.19 \u00b1 0.12 when compared to a pure foreground fit. MSFs are applied to data from LEDA for the first time in this paper and we identify the presence of sinusoidal systematics.
