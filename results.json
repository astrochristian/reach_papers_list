Since this global 21-cm cosmological signal from the Cosmic Dawn is effectively constant on observing timescales and since effects resulting from systematics will vary with time, the effects of these systematics can be mitigated without the need for a model of the systematic. We present a method to account for unmodelled time-varying systematics in 21-cm radio cosmology experiments using a squared-exponential Gaussian process kernel to account for correlations between time bins in a fully Bayesian way. We find by varying the model parameters of a simulated systematic that the Gaussian process method improves our ability to recover the signal parameters by widening the posterior in the presence of a systematic and reducing the bias in the mean fit parameters. When varying the amplitude of a model sinusoidal systematic between 0.25 and 2.00 times the 21-cm signal amplitude and the period between 0.5 and 4.0 times the signal width, we find on average a 5% improvement in the root mean squared error of the fitted signal. We can use the fitted Gaussian process hyperparameters to identify the presence of a systematic in the data, demonstrating the method's utility as a diagnostic tool. Furthermore, we can use Gaussian process regression to calculate a mean fit to the residuals over time, providing a basis for producing a model of the time-varying systematic.", "author": ["Kirkham, Christian J.", "Anstey, Dominic J.", "de Lera Acedo, Eloy"], "date": "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z", "doi": ["10.48550/arXiv.2310.17975"], "first_author": "Kirkham, Christian J.", "keyword": ["Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics", "Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"], "pubdate": "2023-10-00", "title": ["A Bayesian Method to Mitigate the Effects of Unmodelled Time-Varying Systematics for 21-cm Cosmology Experiments"]}, {"bibcode": "2023arXiv231002146A", "abstract": "Contamination by Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a ubiquitous challenge for radio astronomy.

It is demonstrated that using physically motivated foreground models to recover the sky-averaged 21 cm signal one must accurately describe the horizon around the radiometer. We show that not accounting for the horizon will lead to a signal recovery with residuals an order of magnitude larger than the injected signal, with a log Bayesian evidence of almost 1600 lower than when one does account for the horizon.

We also show these parameters may be fitted using Bayesian inference to mitigate for these issues without overfitting and mischaracterising a non-detection. We further demonstrate that signal recovery is sensitive to errors in measurements of the horizon projection onto the sky, but fitting for soil temperature and reflection coefficients with priors that extend beyond physical expectation can resolve these problems.

We present a strategy to reduce this overlap between the 21-cm and foreground modes by simultaneously fitting the spectra from multiple different antennas, which can be used in combination with the method of utilizing the time dependence of foregrounds while fitting multiple drift scan spectra. To demonstrate this idea, we consider two different foreground models (i) a simple foreground model, where we assume a constant spectral index over the sky, and (ii) a more realistic foreground model, with a spatial variation of the spectral index. For the simple foreground model, with just a single antenna design, we are able to extract the signal with good accuracy if we simultaneously fit the data from multiple time slices. The 21-cm signal extraction is further improved when we simultaneously fit the data from different antennas as well. This improvement becomes more pronounced while using the more realistic mock observations generated from the detailed foreground model. We find that even if we fit multiple time slices, the recovered signal is biased and inaccurate for a single antenna.

It has previously been demonstrated that, within such a modelling framework, a foreground model of sufficient fidelity can be generated by dividing the sky into $N$ regions and scaling a base map assuming a distinct uniform spectral index in each region. Using the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) as our fiducial instrument, we show that, if unaccounted-for, amplitude errors in low-frequency radio maps used for our base map model will prevent recovery of the 21-cm signal within this framework, and that the level of bias in the recovered 21-cm signal is proportional to the amplitude and the correlation length of the base-map errors in the region.

In this paper, we present GLOBALEMU, a Global 21-cm signal emulator that uses redshift as a character-defining variable alongside a set of astrophysical parameters to estimate the signal brightness temperature. Combined with physically motivated data pre-processing, this makes for a reliable and fast emulator that is relatively insensitive to the network design. GLOBALEMU can emulate a high-resolution signal in 1.3 ms in comparison to 133 ms, a factor of 102 improvement, when using the existing public state-of-the-art 21CMGEM. We illustrate, with the standard astrophysical models used to train 21CMGEM, that GLOBALEMU is almost twice as accurate and for a test set of \u22481700 signals we achieve a mean root mean squared error of 2.52 mK across the band z = 7-28 [\u224810 per cent the expected noise of the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH)].

We demonstrate that these distortions are sufficient to conceal the 21 cm signal when the antenna is not perfectly achromatic and that simple corrections assuming a constant spatial distribution of foreground power are insufficient to overcome them. We then propose a new physics-motivated method of modelling the foregrounds of 21 cm experiments in order to fit the chromatic distortions as part of the foregrounds. This is done by generating a simulated sky model across the observing band by dividing the sky into N regions and scaling a base map assuming a distinct uniform spectral index in each region. The resulting sky map can then be convolved with a model of the antenna beam to give a model of foregrounds and chromaticity parametrized by the spectral indices of the N regions. We demonstrate that fitting this model for varying N using a Bayesian nested sampling algorithm and comparing the results using the evidence allows the 21 cm signal to be reliably detected in data of a relatively smooth conical log spiral antenna. We also test a much more chromatic conical sinuous antenna and find this model will not produce a reliable signal detection, but in a manner that is easily distinguishable from a true detection.", "alternate_bibcode": ["2020arXiv201009644A", "2021MNRAS.tmp.1520A"], "author": ["Anstey, Dominic", "de Lera Acedo, Eloy", "Handley, Will"], "date": "2021-09-01T00:00:00Z", "doi": ["10.1093/mnras/stab1765", "10.48550/arXiv.2010.09644"], "first_author": "Anstey, Dominic", "issue": "2", "keyword": ["methods: data analysis", "dark ages", "reionization", "first stars", "early Universe", "Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"], "pubdate": "2021-09-00", "title": ["A general Bayesian framework for foreground modelling and chromaticity correction for global 21 cm experiments"]}, {"bibcode": "2021MNRAS.505.2638R", "abstract": "Detection of millikelvin-level signals from the 'Cosmic Dawn' requires an unprecedented level of sensitivity and systematic calibration. We report the theory behind a novel calibration algorithm developed from the formalism introduced by the EDGES collaboration for use in 21-cm experiments. Improvements over previous approaches are provided through the incorporation of a Bayesian framework and machine learning techniques such as the use of Bayesian evidence to determine the level of frequency variation of calibration parameters that is supported by the data, the consideration of correlation between calibration parameters when determining their values, and the use of a conjugate-prior based approach that results in a fast algorithm for application in the field. In self-consistency tests using empirical data models of varying complexity, our methodology is used to calibrate a 50 \u03a9 ambient-temperature load. The RMS error between the calibration solution and the measured temperature of the load is 8 mK, well within the 1 \u03c3 noise level.

From the analyses, we found that the magnitude of the ionospheric disruptions due to ionospheric refraction and absorption can be greater than the expected global 21-cm signal, and the variation of its magnitude can differ, depending on the ionospheric conditions. Within the parameter space adopted in the model, the shape of the global 21-cm signal is distorted after propagating through the ionosphere, while its amplitude is weakened. It is observed that the ionospheric effects do not cancel out over time, and thus should be accounted for in the foreground calibration at each timestep to account for the chromaticity introduced by the ionosphere.", "alternate_bibcode": ["2020arXiv201110517S", "2021MNRAS.tmp..498S"], "author": ["Shen, Emma", "Anstey, Dominic", "de Lera Acedo, Eloy", "Fialkov, Anastasia", "Handley, Will"], "date": "2021-05-01T00:00:00Z", "doi": ["10.1093/mnras/stab429", "10.48550/arXiv.2011.10517"], "first_author": "Shen, Emma", "issue": "1", "keyword": ["atmospheric effects", "methods: data analysis", "Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics", "Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics", "Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"], "pubdate": "2021-05-00", "title": ["Quantifying ionospheric effects on global 21-cm observations"]}, {"bibcode": "2021MNRAS.502.4405B", "abstract": "Maximally Smooth Functions (MSFs) are a form of constrained functions in which there are no inflection points or zero crossings in high-order derivatives. Consequently, they have applications to signal recovery in experiments where signals of interest are expected to be non-smooth features masked by larger smooth signals or foregrounds. They can also act as a powerful tool for diagnosing the presence of systematics. The constrained nature of MSFs makes fitting these functions a non-trivial task. We introduce MAXSMOOTH, an open-source package that uses quadratic programming to rapidly fit MSFs. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of MAXSMOOTH by comparison to commonly used fitting routines and show that we can reduce the fitting time by approximately two orders of magnitude. We introduce and implement with MAXSMOOTH Partially Smooth Functions, which are useful for describing elements of non-smooth structure in foregrounds. This work has been motivated by the problem of foreground modelling in 21-cm cosmology. We discuss applications of MAXSMOOTH to 21-cm cosmology and highlight this with examples using data from the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) and the Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages (LEDA) experiments. We demonstrate the presence of a sinusoidal systematic in the EDGES data with a log-evidence difference of 86.19 \u00b1 0.12 when compared to a pure foreground fit. MSFs are applied to data from LEDA for the first time in this paper and we identify the presence of sinusoidal systematics.
